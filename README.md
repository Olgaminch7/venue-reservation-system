# venue-reservation-system

<h2>Technologies used: SpringJDBC, Integration testing</h2>
<h2>IDE: Eclipse</h2>
<h2>Database: PostgreSQL</h2>

<p>Designed and implemented a venue reservation system through pair programming and utilizing the DAO Pattern. The application interacted with users via a console interface allowing them to search for and reserve available spaces at various venues. Constraints were enforced based on space availability and users received a confirmation with venue space details along with a calculated total cost for the reservation. Developed integration tests for verification.</p>
